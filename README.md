# Banking and Finance Domain: Loan Eligibility Status Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on automating the loan eligibility process for Dream Housing Finance company, which provides home loans. The goal is to create a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer is eligible for a loan based on their personal details provided in an online application form. These details include factors such as gender, marital status, education, number of dependents, income, loan amount, and credit history.

The project aims to use machine learning to automate this process in real-time, targeting specific customer segments who are eligible for loans, based on their application details.

## Business Problem Understanding

Dream Housing Finance company deals with all types of home loans and has a strong presence in urban, semi-urban, and rural areas. The company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (in real-time) using customer details entered during the online application form. This includes several features such as:

- **Gender**
- **Marital Status**
- **Education**
- **Number of Dependents**
- **Income**
- **Loan Amount**
- **Credit History**
- And other relevant information.

The company has provided a dataset to identify customer segments eligible for a loan, with the goal of targeting these customers more effectively. The machine learning model will help classify and predict loan eligibility based on these parameters.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project consists of **13 variables**:

- **8 Categorical Variables**: These include information such as gender, marital status, education, credit history, etc.
- **4 Continuous Variables**: These include numerical details such as income, loan amount, number of dependents, etc.
- **1 Variable for Loan ID**: A unique identifier for each loan application.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shabanaalina14/BANKING-AND-FINANCE-DOMAIN-ETE-ML.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd BANKING-AND-FINANCE-DOMAIN-ETE-ML
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Once you have the project set up, you can run the Jupyter notebooks or execute the Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

### Data Preprocessing

To clean and preprocess the data, you can run the following script:
```bash
python src/preprocessing.py
```

### Model Training

Train your machine learning model by executing:
```bash
python src/model.py
```

### Model Evaluation

Evaluate your model's performance using the metrics provided in the `evaluation.py` script:
```bash
python src/evaluation.py
```

## Technologies

- **Python**: The programming language used for the project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computing and array manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model building, evaluation, and metrics.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and exploration.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive data analysis and experimentation.

## Model Evaluation

The project implements various evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the trained machine learning model, including:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**
- **ROC-AUC**

These metrics help determine the effectiveness of the model in classifying customers as eligible or ineligible for loans based on the given features.
